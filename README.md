### What is Stegory? ###

Stegory is a steganographic tool used to hide images or messages inside of other images. It is my attempt to create a common, easy to use tool that implements steganography as a form of encryption. 

Stegory is currently on version 0.7 and is uncompleted.

### How It Works ####
Stegory uses a form of least significant bit encryption known as 3-2-3 encryption. Stegory includes both an encryption form, where users can plug in a carrier image and a payload image, and receive an encrypted copy of the carrier, as well as a decryption form where users can plug in that same image to decode.

You can find more information on how it really works in [this blog post.](http://www.evklein.com/blog/Steganography)

## Status ##
Stegory is currently in version 0.7, but development has officially ceased. I do plan to eventually revisit the project to implement further functionality and add some features, but there are no official plans in place currently.
